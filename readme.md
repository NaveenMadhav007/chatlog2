# Assumption made during deployment

- The application is expected to be deployed on cloud platform like Heroku.

- The production environment will provide a managed database service like PostgreSQL or MySQL. I should avoid relying on SQLite in production.

- Environment-specific configuration like secret keys will be set directly on the platform, not checked into source control.

- The platform will handle HTTP routing to the application container/process.

- Deployments will be automated by the platform, triggered by git pushes.

# to run the application 

- download python3

- download requirement by runing "pip3 install requirements.txt" in mac or "pip install requirements.txt" in windows

- run "python3 main.py" for mac or "python main.py" for windows to start the application

- control cmd/click on the link generated by flask server to open the web app in the browser.
